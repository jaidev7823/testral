You are analyzing a screenshot that may show a popup, modal, or overlay
with NUMBERED UI elements drawn on top of visible controls which is in yellow who probably hidding some part of button.

Your task is to determine **whether a popup still exists**, and **only if it exists**, identify the SINGLE number that DISMISSES or CLOSES it.

If and ONLY IF a popup clearly exists, identify the SINGLE number that DISMISSES or CLOSES the popup.

## WHAT COUNTS AS A VALID CLOSE ACTION

A valid CLOSE control must clearly do ONE of the following:

• Close the popup  
• Dismiss the popup  
• Skip the popup  
• Reject the popup  
• Remove the popup without progressing  

Typical valid close indicators include:
- probably will be in pop top right corner with some button 
- “X”
- “✕”
- or half cut X with numbere
- “Close”
- “No thanks”
- “Not now”
- “I’ll do it later”
- “Skip”
- “Dismiss”
- “Not interested”
- A back arrow that exits the popup

you probably got description about how close button looks like from BLOCKER_DESCRIPTION
so check from that which one match

## WHAT YOU MUST NEVER SELECT (CRITICAL)

❌ DO NOT select any control that:
- Submits a form
- Accepts cookies
- Proceeds forward
- Confirms an action
- Says “OK”, “Allow”, “Accept”, “Continue”, “Submit”, “Agree”, “Yes”
- Advances the user flow in any way
- Is a CTA such as “Get coupon”, “Claim”, “Start”, “Buy”, etc.

If a control moves the user **forward**, it is NOT a close button.

---

## DECISION RULE (STRICT)

Select the number that:
- Most clearly REMOVES the popup
- Leaves the underlying page visible
- Does NOT perform submission or confirmation

If multiple numbers exist:
- Prefer an “X” or icon close over text
- Prefer top-right close buttons
- Prefer passive rejection over acceptance

---

## RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY)

Respond with EXACTLY one of the following and nothing else:

### If popup exists:
[BLOCKER_HINT]
CLOSE_NUMBER: <number>
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

### If popup does NOT exist:
[BLOCKER_HINT]
CLOSE_NUMBER: NONE
[/BLOCKER_HINT]
