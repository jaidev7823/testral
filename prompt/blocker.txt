You are analyzing a screenshot that may show a popup, modal, or overlay
with NUMBERED UI elements drawn on top of visible controls.

Your task is to determine **whether a popup still exists**, and **only if it exists**, identify the SINGLE number that DISMISSES or CLOSES it.

---

## STEP 1 — POPUP EXISTENCE CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before selecting any number, you MUST first decide:

**Does a popup, modal, or overlay ACTUALLY exist in this screenshot?**

A popup EXISTS only if:
- It visually blocks or overlays the main page content, OR
- It clearly demands attention before interacting with the page, OR
- The background page appears dimmed, blurred, frozen, or partially inaccessible

A popup does NOT exist if:
- The page looks like a normal webpage section
- The overlay appears to have disappeared
- The content is fully scrollable and unobstructed
- The numbered elements belong to normal page navigation, hero banners, sliders, or links

### If NO popup exists:
Respond EXACTLY with:

[BLOCKER_HINT]
CLOSE_NUMBER: NONE
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

⚠️ Do NOT guess.
⚠️ Do NOT select any number if the popup is gone.

## STEP 2 — VALID CLOSE ACTION (ONLY IF POPUP EXISTS)

If and ONLY IF a popup clearly exists, identify the SINGLE number that DISMISSES or CLOSES the popup.

---

## WHAT COUNTS AS A VALID CLOSE ACTION

A valid CLOSE control must clearly do ONE of the following:

• Close the popup  
• Dismiss the popup  
• Skip the popup  
• Reject the popup  
• Remove the popup without progressing  

Typical valid close indicators include:
- “X”
- “✕”
- “Close”
- “No thanks”
- “Not now”
- “I’ll do it later”
- “Skip”
- “Dismiss”
- “Not interested”
- A back arrow that exits the popup

---

## WHAT YOU MUST NEVER SELECT (CRITICAL)

❌ DO NOT select any control that:
- Submits a form
- Accepts cookies
- Proceeds forward
- Confirms an action
- Says “OK”, “Allow”, “Accept”, “Continue”, “Submit”, “Agree”, “Yes”
- Advances the user flow in any way
- Is a CTA such as “Get coupon”, “Claim”, “Start”, “Buy”, etc.

If a control moves the user **forward**, it is NOT a close button.

---

## DECISION RULE (STRICT)

Select the number that:
- Most clearly REMOVES the popup
- Leaves the underlying page visible
- Does NOT perform submission or confirmation

If multiple numbers exist:
- Prefer an “X” or icon close over text
- Prefer top-right close buttons
- Prefer passive rejection over acceptance

---

## RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY)

Respond with EXACTLY one of the following and nothing else:

### If popup exists:
[BLOCKER_HINT]
CLOSE_NUMBER: <number>
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

### If popup does NOT exist:
[BLOCKER_HINT]
CLOSE_NUMBER: NONE
[/BLOCKER_HINT]
