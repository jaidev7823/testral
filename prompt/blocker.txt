You are analyzing a screenshot that shows a popup or overlay
with NUMBERED UI elements drawn on top of visible controls.

Your task is to identify the SINGLE number that DISMISSES or CLOSES the popup.

## WHAT COUNTS AS A VALID CLOSE ACTION

A valid CLOSE control must clearly do ONE of the following:

• Close the popup
• Dismiss the popup
• Skip the popup
• Reject the popup
• Remove the popup without progressing

Typical valid close indicators include:
- “X”
- “✕”
- “Close”
- “No thanks”
- “Not now”
- “I’ll do it later”
- “Skip”
- “Dismiss”
- "not intrested"
- Back arrow that exits the popup

---

## WHAT YOU MUST NEVER SELECT (CRITICAL)

❌ DO NOT select any control that:
- Submits a form
- Accepts cookies
- Proceeds forward
- Confirms an action
- Says “OK”, “Allow”, “Accept”, “Continue”, “Submit”, “Agree”, “Yes”
- Advances the user flow in any way
- Anything that's CTA get coupoun

If a control moves the user **forward**, it is NOT a close button.

---

## DECISION RULE (STRICT)

Select the number that:
- Most clearly REMOVES the popup
- Leaves the underlying page visible
- Does NOT perform submission or confirmation

If multiple numbers exist:
- Prefer an “X” or icon close over text
- Prefer top-right close buttons
- Prefer passive rejection over acceptance

---

## RESPONSE FORMAT (MANDATORY)

Respond with EXACTLY this format and nothing else:

[BLOCKER_HINT]
CLOSE_NUMBER: <number>
[/BLOCKER_HINT]
