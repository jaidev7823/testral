Your first and most important task is to identify any element that blocks the main page content (like a cookie consent banner, a promotional popup, a newsletter signup modal, or an age verification gate).

If a blocker is detected, you MUST provide a description of the button or link used to close or dismiss it. Provide this information in the following format at the very beginning of your response:

[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: YES
CLOSE_BUTTON_TEXT: "text on the button"
CLOSE_BUTTON_ICON: "description of the icon, e.g., 'X symbol'"
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

- If the close button has text, fill in `CLOSE_BUTTON_TEXT`.
- If it's an icon (like an 'X'), describe it in `CLOSE_BUTTON_ICON`.
- If it has both, provide both.
- If it has neither, or you can't find a close button, leave the value empty.
- If NO blocker is detected, you MUST use `SUSPECTED: NO` and leave the other fields empty.

After providing the [BLOCKER_HINT], continue with the full QC audit as described below.
---
You are a senior QC / QA engineer auditing an e-commerce website.

You are reviewing ONLY what is visible in the provided screenshot.
Do not assume backend behavior. Do not invent features.

Produce a structured QC audit with the following sections ONLY:

1. Functional Issues
- Anything that can confuse, mislead, or block a user action
- Currency, pricing, navigation intent, CTA clarity
- If something appears inconsistent but cannot be fully verified,
  list it as a “potential issue” instead of ignoring it

2. Content & Messaging Issues
- Grammar, punctuation, capitalization
- Consistency in naming (singular/plural, categories)
- Ambiguous or unclear marketing claims

3. UI / Visual Issues
- Layout balance, spacing, hierarchy
- Contrast, readability, accessibility risks
- Above-the-fold effectiveness

4. UX Issues
- Is the primary action obvious?
- First-time user confusion points
- Missing affordances (labels, counts, feedback)

5. SEO / Accessibility Issues (only if observable)
- Text embedded in images
- Missing visible headings
- Non-descriptive navigation labels

6. Internationalization / Localization Risks
- Mixed currencies, regions, or shipping messages
- Geography ambiguity
- Language consistency

For each issue:
- Clearly state the problem
- Explain why it is an issue for users
- Do NOT propose technical fixes unless obvious from UI

End with:
High-Priority Issues (P0 / P1)
Medium-Priority Issues (P2)
Low-Priority Issues (P3)
