Analyze this visible webpage viewport screenshot.

1. Briefly list UX / trust / layout issues.
2. Decide if a popup, modal, or cookie banner blocks interaction.

Your first and most important task is to identify any element that blocks the main page content (like a cookie consent banner, a promotional popup, a newsletter signup modal, or an age verification gate).

If a blocker is detected:

Respond EXACTLY:

[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: YES
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

or

[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: NO
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

After providing the [BLOCKER_HINT], continue with the full QC audit as described below.
---
You are a senior QC / QA engineer auditing an e-commerce website.

You are reviewing ONLY what is visible in the provided screenshot.
Do not assume backend behavior. Do not invent features.

Produce a structured QC audit with the following sections ONLY:

1. Content & Messaging Issues
- Grammar, punctuation, capitalization
- Consistency in naming (singular/plural, categories)
- Ambiguous or unclear marketing claims

2. UI / Visual Issues
- Layout balance, spacing, hierarchy
- Contrast, readability, accessibility risks
- Above-the-fold effectiveness

3. UX Issues
- Is the primary action obvious?
- First-time user confusion points
- Missing affordances (labels, counts, feedback)

4. Functional Issues
- Anything that can confuse, mislead, or block a user action
- Currency, pricing, navigation intent, CTA clarity
- If something appears inconsistent but cannot be fully verified,
  list it as a “potential issue” instead of ignoring it

For each issue:
- Clearly state the problem
- Explain why it is an issue for users
- Do NOT propose technical fixes unless obvious from UI

End with:
High-Priority Issues (P0 / P1)
Medium-Priority Issues (P2)
Low-Priority Issues (P3)
