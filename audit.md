- Screenshot: screenshots/step_1_clean.png

```
[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: YES
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "From Everyday Nude to Party Sparkle It's All Here."
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The sentence is missing a comma after "Nude" and "Sparkle" to properly separate the introductory phrase from the main clause. Additionally, "It's" should be capitalized ("It's") as it follows a period in the previous sentence.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Hey! Looking for something special? I'm here to give you a personalized shopping experience."
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The exclamation mark after "Hey!" is unnecessary and informal for a professional context. The sentence should be grammatically consistent with the rest of the page's tone.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Beauty Bundle" (in the category navigation)
TYPE: terminology consistency
EXPLANATION: The term "Beauty Bundle" is inconsistent in capitalization with other category labels (e.g., "Matte Foundation," "Lipstick Rush"). The first letter should be capitalized but the rest should not be all caps.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Lips" (heading)
TYPE: text style consistency
EXPLANATION: The heading "Lips" is not capitalized, while other category headings like "Eyes" are also lowercase, but the inconsistency in capitalization of other labels (e.g., "Matte Foundation") suggests a need for uniformity.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Eyes" (heading)
TYPE: text style consistency
EXPLANATION: Similar to "Lips," the heading "Eyes" is lowercase, but the rest of the page uses inconsistent capitalization for labels. This should be aligned with the rest of the page's headings.

```
[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: NO
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Cmc Flattering Nude Lipstick"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: Likely a typo or branding inconsistency; "Cmc" appears inconsistent with the rest of the product names (e.g., "Cmc Matte Foundation"). The product name should be consistent with the brand's style.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "foundation??"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The use of triple question marks ("???") is informal and inconsistent with the professional tone of the rest of the text.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Bold, Beautiful & always on point"
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The phrase "always on point" is grammatically inconsistent with the preceding adjectives ("Bold, Beautiful"). The use of an ampersand (&) instead of "and" is stylistic but not incorrect; however, the lack of a conjunction between the last two words creates a slight inconsistency in flow.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "your secret to a smooth, radiant look"
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The phrase "your secret to a smooth, radiant look" is grammatically correct but lacks a clear subject-verb agreement in the context of the heading. The phrasing is slightly awkward and could be improved for clarity.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "LIPSTICK" (heading)
TYPE: text style consistency
EXPLANATION: The word "LIPSTICK" is in ALL CAPS, while the rest of the sentence ("Bold, Beautiful & always on point") is not. This creates an inconsistency in text style.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "CONCEALER" (heading)
TYPE: text style consistency
EXPLANATION: The word "CONCEALER" is in ALL CAPS, while the rest of the sentence ("your secret to a smooth, radiant look") is not. This creates an inconsistency in text style. Additionally, the phrase "your secret to" is grammatically incomplete and awkwardly placed.

```
[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: NO
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Eyes that mesmerize"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The phrase should likely be "Eyes that mesmerize" (correct as is, but "mesmerize" is grammatically correct here; however, the intended phrasing may have been "Eyes that mesmerize" or "Eyes that mesmerise" depending on regional spelling preference. No error, but "mesmerize" is the standard American English spelling.)

---
ISSUE:
TEXT: "A little blush, a lot of charm!"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The exclamation mark is correctly placed, but the phrasing is informal and grammatically correct. No error.

---
ISSUE:
TEXT: "Why choose us?"
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The phrasing is grammatically correct but could be considered slightly informal for a heading. No error.

---
ISSUE:
TEXT: "Cruelty-Free"
TYPE: terminology consistency
EXPLANATION: The capitalization is inconsistent with the rest of the icons (e.g., "Inclusive" is capitalized but not hyphenated in the same way). The hyphen is unnecessary here as "Cruelty Free" is a common phrasing, but the capitalization is inconsistent with the other icons.

---
ISSUE:
TEXT: "Inclusive"
TYPE: terminology consistency
EXPLANATION: The capitalization is inconsistent with the other icons (e.g., "Cruelty-Free" has a hyphen). No error in itself, but inconsistent with the formatting of other icons.

---
ISSUE:
TEXT: "Intense colour"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The word "colour" is spelled with a "u" (British English), while the other text elements use American English ("color"). Inconsistent spelling.

---
ISSUE:
TEXT: "Vegan"
TYPE: terminology consistency
EXPLANATION: The capitalization is inconsistent with the other icons (e.g., "Inclusive" and "Intense colour"). No error, but inconsistent formatting.

```
[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: NO
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "How to Build a Winter Makeup Travel Kit (Essentials Only)"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The phrase "How to Build" is inconsistent with the rest of the blog post titles, which use "How to" without the "Build" verb in the title itself (e.g., "How To Choose the Right Cosmetics & Beauty Products For Your Daily Need?").

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "5 Easy Christmas Makeup Looks to Shine This Festive Season"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The word "Christmas" is capitalized inconsistently with the rest of the text on the page (e.g., "Winter" in "Winter Makeup Travel Kit" is not capitalized in the same way).

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "7 New Year's Eve Makeup Ideas to Welcome 2026 in Styl"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The word "Styl" is likely a typo and should be "Style" for grammatical correctness.

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "How To Choose the Right Cosmetics & Beauty Products For Your Daily Need?"
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The phrase "For Your Daily Need?" is awkwardly phrased. It should be "For Your Daily Needs?" or "For Your Daily Routine?" for clarity and correctness.

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "1. Know Your Skin Type:"
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The colon at the end of the heading is unnecessary and incorrect. It should be a period or no punctuation at all.

## Step 11 — Initial Audit
- Screenshot: screenshots/step_11_clean.png

```
[BLOCKER_HINT]
SUSPECTED: NO
[/BLOCKER_HINT]

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Selecting the appropriate products cosmetics and out your natural radian for your everyday or makeup use may be that overfulling coverage"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: "cosmetics" is incorrectly hyphenated ("cosmetics and" instead of "cosmetic products"), "out" should likely be "bring out," "radian" is misspelled ("radian" instead of "radiance"), and "overfulling" is misspelled ("overfulling" instead of "overwhelming").

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Having Complete Quality Control Over The Products"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: "Complete" should be capitalized as "Complete" (already correct), but "Quality" should be capitalized as "Quality" (already correct). However, the phrasing is awkwardly worded; it should be "having complete quality control over the products" (no capitalization needed for "complete" here).

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Our Goal, Having Complete Quality Control Over The Products, Is To Move Towards Organic And Environmentally-Friendly Products."
TYPE: grammar
EXPLANATION: The comma after "Goal" is unnecessary. The sentence should read: "Our goal is to move towards organic and environmentally-friendly products, having complete quality control over the products." (The clause "Having complete quality control over the products" should be rephrased for clarity and proper sentence structure.)

---

ISSUE:
TEXT: "FQllow Latest Updates & New Launches"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: "FQllow" is misspelled ("Follow" instead of "FQllow").

---
No other spelling, grammar, or text consistency issues found.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "JOIN OUR AFFILIATE PROGRAM & EARN 10% COMMISSION!"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The word "COMMISSION!" is missing a space before the exclamation mark, which is inconsistent with standard punctuation practices.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "The Brand Originated From A Genuine Cosmetics We..."
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The word "Originated" is incorrectly hyphenated ("Originated From" should be "Originated from" without a hyphen).

ISSUE:
TEXT: "The Products. Our Goal, Starting With Our First Line, Is To Move Towards Organic And Environmentally-Friendly Products."
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The word "Environmentally-Friendly" is hyphenated, but the rest of the sentence lacks consistent hyphenation or spacing (e.g., "Organic And" should be "Organic and" for consistency).

ISSUE:
TEXT: "FACE", "LIP", "EYE", "BEAUTY BUNDLE", "PREP & SET", "NEW ARRIVALS", "CHARMACY STUDIO"
TYPE: terminology consistency
EXPLANATION: The categories under "CATEGORIES" are inconsistent in capitalization and phrasing. Some are all caps ("FACE"), some are title case ("Beauty Bundle"), and some are mixed ("PREP & SET"). The hyphen in "PREP & SET" is inconsistent with the rest of the page's phrasing.

ISSUE:
TEXT: "CHARMACY Milano"
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The brand name is inconsistently capitalized ("CHARMACY" vs. "Milano" in lowercase).

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Affiliate Program" (in "Useful Links") vs. "AFFILIATE PROGRAM" (in the header)
TYPE: terminology consistency
EXPLANATION: The phrase "Affiliate Program" is inconsistently capitalized between the header ("AFFILIATE PROGRAM") and the footer ("Affiliate Program").

ISSUE:
TEXT: "Return & Refund Policy" (in "Useful Links")
TYPE: typo
EXPLANATION: The word "Refund" is incorrectly hyphenated ("Return & Refund" should be "Return and Refund" for consistency with the rest of the page).
